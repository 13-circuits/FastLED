FastLED
=======

This is a library for easily & efficiently controlling a wide variety of LED chipsets, like the ones
sold by adafruit (Neopixel, LPD8806), Sparkfun (WS2801), and aliexpress.  In addition to writing to the
leds, this library also includes a number of functions for high-performing 8bit math for manipulating
your RGB values, as well as low level classes for abstracting out access to pins and SPI hardware, while
still keeping things as fast as possible.

*TODO* - document supported chipsets
*TODO* - provide simple sample code in readme
*TODO* - provide link to full documentation in readme.
*TODO* - get candy
